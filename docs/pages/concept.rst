Typeclass
---------

So, typeclasses help us to build new abstractions near the existing types,
not inside them.

Basically, we will learn how to dispatch
different logic based on predefined set of types.

Steps
~~~~~

To use typeclasses you should understand these steps:

.. mermaid::
  :caption: Typeclass steps.

   graph LR
       F1["Typeclass definition"] --> F2["Instance definition"]
       F2                         --> F2
       F2                         --> F3["Calling"]

Let's walk through this process step by step.
The first on is "Typeclass definition", where we create a new typeclass:

.. code:: python

  >>> from classes import typeclass
  >>> from typing import Union

  >>> @typeclass
  ... def to_json(instance) -> str:
  ...     """That's a definition!"""

When typeclass is defined it only has a name and a signature
that all instances will share.
Let's define some instances:

.. code:: python

  >>> @to_json.instance(str)
  ... def _to_json_str(instance: str) -> str:
  ...     return '"{0}"'.format(instance)

  >>> @to_json.instance(int)
  ... @to_json.instance(float)
  ... def _to_json_int_float(instance: Union[float, int]) -> str:
  ...     return str(instance)

  >>> @to_json.instance(None)
  ... def _to_json_none(instance: None) -> str:
  ...     return 'null'

That's how we define instances for our typeclass.
These instances will be executed when the corresponding type will be supplied.

And the last step is to call our typeclass
with different value of different types:

.. code:: python

  >>> assert to_json('text') == '"text"'
  >>> assert to_json(1) == '1'
  >>> assert to_json(1.5) == '1.5'
  >>> assert to_json(None) == 'null'

That's it. There's nothing extra about typeclasses. They can be:

- defined
- extended by new instances
- and called


Protocols
---------

We also support ``Protocol`` items to be registered,
the only difference is that they do require ``is_protocol=True``
to be specified on ``.instance()`` call:

.. code:: python

  >>> from typing import Sequence

  >>> @to_json.instance(Sequence, is_protocol=True)
  ... def _to_json_sequence(instance: Sequence) -> str:
  ...     return '[{0}]'.format(', '.join(to_json(i) for i in instance))

  >>> assert to_json([1, 'a', None]) == '[1, "a", null]'


Type resolution order
---------------------

Here's how typeclass resolve types:

1. We try to resolve exact match by a passed type
2. Then we try to match passed type a given protocols, first match wins
3. Then we traverse ``mro`` entries of a given type, first match wins

We use cache, so calling typeclasses with same object types is fast.

In other words, it can fallback to more common types:

.. code:: python

  >>> from classes import typeclass

  >>> @typeclass
  ... def example(instance) -> str:
  ...     ...

  >>> class A(object):
  ...     ...

  >>> class B(A):
  ...     ...

  >>> @example.instance(A)
  ... def _example_a(instance: A) -> str:
  ...     return 'a'

Now, let's test that the fallback to more common types work:

  >>> assert example(A()) == 'a'
  >>> assert example(B()) == 'a'

And now, let's specify a special case for ``B``:

.. code:: python

  >>> @example.instance(B)
  ... def _example_b(instance: B) -> str:
  ...     return 'b'

  >>> assert example(A()) == 'a'
  >>> assert example(B()) == 'b'

How it fallback works?
We traverse the ``mro`` of a given type and find the closest supported type.
This helps us to still treat first typeclass argument as covariant.

There's even a pattern to allow all objects in:

.. code:: python

  >>> @example.instance(object)
  ... def _example_all_in(instance: object) -> str:
  ...     return 'obj'

  >>> assert example(A()) == 'a'
  >>> assert example(B()) == 'b'

  >>> assert example(1) == 'obj'
  >>> assert example(None) == 'obj'
  >>> assert example('a') == 'obj'


supports typeguard
------------------

You can check if a typeclass is supported via ``.supports()`` method.
Example:

.. code:: python

  >>> from classes import typeclass

  >>> @typeclass
  ... def convert_to_number(instance) -> int:
  ...     ...

  >>> @convert_to_number.instance(int)
  ... def _convert_int(instance: int) -> int:
  ...     return instance

  >>> @convert_to_number.instance(float)
  ... def _convert_float(instance: float) -> int:
  ...     return int(instance)

  >>> assert convert_to_number.supports(1) is True
  >>> assert convert_to_number.supports(1.5) is True
  >>> assert convert_to_number.supports({}) is False

It uses the same runtime dispatching mechanism as calling a typeclass directly,
but returns a boolean.

It also uses `TypeGuard <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0647/>`_ type
to narrow types inside ``if convert_to_number.supports(item)`` blocks:

.. code:: python

  >>> from typing import Union
  >>> from random import randint

  >>> def get_random_item() -> Union[int, dict]:
  ...    return {'example': 1} if randint(0, 1) else 1

  >>> item: Union[int, dict] = get_random_item()

So, if you try to call ``convert_to_number(item)`` right now,
it won't pass ``mypy`` typecheck and will possibly throw runtime exception,
because ``dict`` is not supported by ``convert_to_number`` typeclass.

So, you can narrow the type with our ``TypeGuard``:

  >>> if convert_to_number.supports(item):
  ...    # `reveal_type(item)` will produce `Union[int, float]`,
  ...    # or basically all the types that are supported by `to_json`,
  ...    # now you can safely call `to_json`, `mypy` will be happy:
  ...    assert convert_to_number(1.5) == 1


Typeclasses with associated types
---------------------------------

You can also define typeclasses with associated types.
It will allow you to use ``Supports`` type later on.

The syntax looks like this:

.. code:: python

  >>> from classes import AssociatedType, typeclass

  >>> class CanBeTrimmed(AssociatedType):  # Associated type definition
  ...     ...

  >>> @typeclass(CanBeTrimmed)
  ... def can_be_trimmed(instance, length: int) -> str:
  ...    ...

The instance definition syntax is the same:

.. code:: python

   >>> @can_be_trimmed.instance(str)
   ... def _can_be_trimmed_str(instance: str, length: int) -> str:
   ...     return instance[:length]

   >>> assert can_be_trimmed('abcde', 3) == 'abc'

Defining typeclasses as Python classes
will be the only option if you need to use :ref:`Supports <supports>` type.


.. _type-restrictions:

Type restrictions
-----------------

You can restrict typeclasses
to have only subtypes of some specific types during typechecking
(we will still accept all types in runtime).

.. code:: python

  >>> from classes import typeclass

  >>> class A(object):
  ...     ...

  >>> class B(A):
  ...     ...

  >>> @typeclass
  ... def example(instance: A) -> str:
  ...     ...

With this setup, this will typecheck:

.. code:: python

  >>> @example.instance(A)
  ... def _example_a(instance: A) -> str:
  ...     return 'a'

  >>> @example.instance(B)
  ... def _example_b(instance: B) -> str:
  ...     return 'b'

  >>> assert example(A()) == 'a'
  >>> assert example(B()) == 'b'

But, this won't typecheck:

.. code:: python

  >>> @example.instance(int)
  ... def _example_int(instance: int) -> str:
  ...    return 'int'

  # error: Instance "builtins.int" does not match original type "ex.A"
