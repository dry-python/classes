"""
Typeclasses for Python.

.. rubric:: Basic usage

The first and the simplest example of a typeclass is just its definition:

.. code:: python

    >>> from classes import typeclass

    >>> @typeclass
    ... def example(instance) -> str:
    ...     '''Example typeclass.'''

    >>> example(1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError: Missing matched typeclass instance for type: int

In this example we work with the default implementation of a typeclass.
It raises a ``NotImplementedError`` when no instances match.
And we don't yet have a special case for ``int``,
that why we fallback to the default implementation.

It works almost like a regular function right now.
Let's do the next step and introduce
the ``int`` instance for our typeclass:

.. code:: python

    >>> @example.instance(int)
    ... def _example_int(instance: int) -> str:
    ...     return 'int case'

    >>> assert example(1) == 'int case'

Now we have a specific instance for ``int``
which does something different from the default implementation.

What will happen if we pass something new, like ``str``?

.. code:: python

    >>> example('a')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError: Missing matched typeclass instance for type: str

Because again, we don't yet have
an instance of this typeclass for ``str`` type.
Let's fix that.

.. code:: python

    >>> @example.instance(str)
    ... def _example_str(instance: str) -> str:
    ...     return instance

    >>> assert example('a') == 'a'

Now it works with ``str`` as well. But differently.
This allows developer to base the implementation on type information.

So, the rule is clear:
if we have a typeclass instance for a specific type,
then it will be called,
otherwise the default implementation will be called instead.

.. rubric:: Protocols

We also support protocols. It has the same limitation as ``Generic`` types.
It is also dispatched after all regular instances are checked.

To work with protocols, one needs to pass ``is_protocol`` flag to instance:

.. code:: python

    >>> from typing import Sequence

    >>> @example.instance(Sequence, is_protocol=True)
    ... def _sequence_example(instance: Sequence) -> str:
    ...     return ','.join(str(item) for item in instance)

    >>> assert example([1, 2, 3]) == '1,2,3'

But, ``str`` will still have higher priority over ``Sequence``:

.. code:: python

    >>> assert example('abc') == 'abc'

We also support user-defined protocols:

.. code:: python

    >>> from typing_extensions import Protocol

    >>> class CustomProtocol(Protocol):
    ...     field: str

    >>> @example.instance(CustomProtocol, is_protocol=True)
    ... def _custom_protocol_example(instance: CustomProtocol) -> str:
    ...     return instance.field

Now, let's build a class that match this protocol and test it:

.. code:: python

    >>> class WithField(object):
    ...    field: str = 'with field'

    >>> assert example(WithField()) == 'with field'

          Only modified once during ``@typeclass`` creation

        - ``_SignatureType`` is used to ensure that all parameters
          for all type cases are the same.
